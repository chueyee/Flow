## Every Day Organization Application

We keep track of our health and fitness activities, why not also our brain and mental activities?

The goal of this project is to create an application and that track and remind you of your everyday tasks, 
while encouraging you to finish your daily set goal of productive hours.

Like Google Fit or any other fitness application, there will be a goal to be set by the user of how many hours a day
he/she would like to spend being productive. A simple touch will begin tracking and another to pause the progress when you're
no longer productive with updates throughout the day reminding and encouraging you to reach your goal.

Furthermore, the application can sync with your Google Calendar allowing you to also keep track of your daily events and reminders.

It's an all-in-one application and can organize your life and get you going with a simple touch of a button.
